A QGIS plugin was made and is currently hosted on the QGIS plugin repository.  This plugin constructs an Attribute table with a column that describes Empty and null geometry values, or, the geometry type.  Use of this plugin aids GIS users to understand how data is being parsed to and from data sources.  With time, this plugin may help to demystify GIS for database professionals, and, allow different approaches of introducing geometry dataset information into the attribute table.
