# geomAttribute
A QGIS 3 plugin that shows an attribute table with a column that describes geometry.  This plugin was started by Philip Whitten as a component of his MGIS Capstone Project at Penn State University in 2018.  The capstone project is supervised by James Obrien.  The intent of this Capstone Project is make QGIS more efficient and productive with databases that contain null or empty geometries.

This plugin will not work with any version of QGIS earlier than Version 3.
